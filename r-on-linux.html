<a href="https://cran.r-project.org" style="font-size: 4em;">R</a>
is one of those programs that I prefer to install from source code on Linux.
This is mainly because, as a package developer, I frequently install nightly R
development builds anyway for package testing, and for general computing I like
to work with the most recent stable release (which is updated semiannually).

<p>
R's use of system BLAS (basic linear algebra subroutines) and LAPACK libraries
is of particular importance to me because I often work on problems with
significant linear algebra components. I prefer to build R with the default
(and slow) shared reference libraries and then post-installation swap out
libraries using symbolic links as described in the R administration manual
here: 
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html#Shared-BLAS">https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html#Shared-BLAS</a>
This approach adds an extra post-installation step, but makes it easy
to experiment with lots of different BLAS libraries by simply changing
a link.

If you're on Windows systems, this old talk
<a href="http://goo.gl/gcPezs">http://goo.gl/gcPezs</a> has a short section
on installing R with a high-performance BLAS library on Windows. (It's a bit
old now and might need to be updated, but the general idea is there.)
</p>

Here is how I build and install R on Debian (Ubuntu)-like Linux systems,
shown using the latest stable version of R at the time of this writing.
<pre style="background-color: #eee;">
Prepare your operating system to build R, installing required dependencies
sudo apt-get build-dep r-base

# Depending on your OS you might also want (pick your favorite CURL variant)
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev

# Download R source code
wget https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-3/R-3.3.1.tar.gz

# Uncompress R source code
tar xf R-3.3.1.tar.gz

# Configure R
# --enable-memory-profiling (compile support for Rprofmem--useful!)
# --enable-R-shlib  (needed by RStudio if you're in to that kind of thing)
# Note that --with-blas and --with-lapack are set by default to use
# the reference versions, as is the  --enable-BLAS-shlib setting (except on AIX).
# R will be installed into /usr/local by default, OK with me!

cd R-3.3.1
./configure --enable-memory-profiling --enable-R-shlib
make -j 4     # change the '4' to the number of CPUs you've got for faster compilation
sudo make install
</pre>

At this point, R is installed with reference BLAS and LAPACK libraries. These
are great for testing, but don't use threading and even more importantly don't
use vector floating-point CPU instructions. That means that things like matrix
multiplication, eigenvalues, and SVDs will run more slowly than they could on
nearly all processors.

The <a href="https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS">Open BLAS</a> project is an
open-source version of the superb Goto BLAS library. It provides extremely good
use of vectorized CPU instructions and CPU caches and support for OpenMP
threading, and its performance rivals and sometimes exceeds the best commercial
BLAS libraries like the Intel MKL (depending on your processor of course).

Here is how I enable OpenBLAS for R on my Ubuntu system:
<pre style="background-color: #eee;">
sudo apt-get install libopenblas-dev
cd /usr/local/lib/R/lib
sudo mv libRblas.so libRblas.so-reference      # keep a copy for posterity
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/openblas-base/libblas.so.3 libRblas.so
</pre>

Optionally, also link the R LAPACK library. This step is generall much less
important for overall performance, and depending on the libraries used might
not even work (LAPACK is less well-covered than the BLAS API in some
libraries, so some important functions might be missing).
<pre>
sudo mv libRlapack.so libRlapack.so-reference
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/openblas-base/libblas.so.3 libRlapack.so
</pre>

Your machine is now equipped with R + a great BLAS/LAPACK library!

<h3>SMT/Hyperthreading</h3>

If you're using the Intel MKL BLAS library, then you don't have to worry about
this section. If you're using OpenBLAS or some other OpenMP-based threading
BLAS library (including the AMD ACML BLAS), then this section can improve your
performance! The MKL BLAS knows how to deal with SMT optimally on its own.

Some Intel systems (and soon, some new AMD Zen processor systems) can run more
than one thread per physical CPU core, sometimes called hyperthreading or
simultaneous multi-threading. This can work really well for mixed
integer/floating-point workloads, but can sometimes slow things down for heavy
floating-point only computations (because there is only one floating point unit
per core typically).

If hyperthreading is enabled on your system, you'll want to start R so that it
is limited to using the total number of physical threads on your system in OpenMP code
by setting the OMP_NUM_THREADS system variable. For instance:
<pre style="background-color: #eee;">
OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 R
</pre>
tells R to use at most 4 threads, corresponding to a computer with four physical
CPU cores. If you don't specify a thread limit, OpenMP defaults to using the
maximum number of threads reported by the system, which may be too many for floating point operations.
<p>
Note! Some processors have one floating point unit per
core, others might not. For instance, the AMD Opteron 6380 processor has
only one floating point unit for every <i>two</i> CPU cores.

You can set this as default by putting a line like:
<pre style="background-color: #eee;">
echo "export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4" >> ~/.bashrc
</pre>
in your bash start up file (assuming you use the bash shell, which you should!).
