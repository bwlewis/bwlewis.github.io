<h3>Where?</h3>
Find the code here: <a href="http://github.com/bwlewis/R4P/">http://github.com/bwlewis/R4P</a>.

Find R here: <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org</a>.

Find Processing here: <a href="http://processing.org/">http://processing.org</a>.
<h3>What?</h3>
R4P helps Processing and R interact.
It's distributed as an R package, but includes both R and Processing parts
and is generally designed to be used from Processing.
<br><br>
Processing programs invoke an
R engine using the Java-R interface (JRI) from the 
<a href="http://www.rforge.net/rJava/">rJava</a>
R package.  Many Processing functions are exposed to R scripts through a 
high-level interface function. Similarly, Processing programs may use
R functions through the JRI interface.
The package also includes a basic Processing output device for 
R graphics.
<br><br>
R4P includes a few example sketches that are installed into your Processing
sketchbook directory.
<h3>Why?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Processing is really good for animation and interactive graphics; R not
so much.
</li>
<li>
R is fantastic for scientific computing and technical graphics; Processing
not so much.
</li>
</ul>
Thus, R4P tries to make the languages relatively easily interoperable
to obtain a system good at technical interactive graphics, animation,
and scientific computing.
<p>
One of the included examples is a re-implementation of the "boids"
bird flocking simulation included in Processing. The new implementation
computes the flock motion in R but displays it with Processing. It also
shows how R can handle simple mouse interaction (the position of
a repulsor/attractor), as well as compute
flock density "contours." Contour plots, somewhat tricky
to produce natively in Processing, are one-liners in R. The example plot
was produced by R plotting to the Processing output device using:
<br/><br/>
<code>
contour(X,col=5,nlevels=5,drawlabels=FALSE)
</code>
<br/><br/>
The example may seem somewhat
contrived, but it does illustrate combining nifty features of each language.
A video of the example appears below:

<h3>Doc</h3>
The R package includes the following basic documentation:

<a href="./R4P/pdev.html">Basic Processing graphics device for R</a>
<br>
<a href="./R4P/Process.html">High-level Processing function interface for R</a>
<h3>Warnings?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Right now, it's only set up for use with GNU/Linux, although it can easily be 
extended to other platforms like Windows.
</li>
<li>
Processing binaries are generally 32-bit programs (as of December '09).
However, most folks run 64-bit versions of R. Due to the tight coupling
of Processing and R in R4P, one must use bit-compatible versions of the
languages. That usually means manually building a 64-bit version of
Processing from source. Instructions may be found here:
<a href="http://dev.processing.org/build/">http://dev.processing.org/build/</a>.
Note that I've had trouble building certain parts of Processing on GNU/Linux;
in particular OpenGL support.

<li>R4P is in infancy; expect issues and if capable, help to resolve them!
