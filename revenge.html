<h3>Generational Vengeance. A Parable?</h3>

In 1982 Al Gore organized a hearing on climate change in the United States
House of Representatives featuring dire warnings about potential global
catastrophe by James Hansen, then head of NASA Goddard. Even earlier, in 1977,
Exxon scientists prepared a report that stated "... there is general scientific
agreement that the most likely manner in which mankind is influencing the 
global climate is through carbon dioxide release from the burning of fossil
fuels." 

<p>
More than a generation of people have long known what is now plain to see:
future generations shall inherit a planet beset by climate catastrophe.  Fresh
water shortages, mass global migration away from newly uninhabitable places,
regular massively energetic storms, mass extinction, pestilence, suffering.

<p>
Perhaps fittingly, the current youth generation is largely immune to the
effects of, if not infection by, the coronavirus. A virus highly lethal to
older generations.
Science tells us now that our young generation can help stop the spread of the
pandemic by avoiding socializing. No school, no graduations, no travel, no bar
hopping, no work even.

<p>
Should the youth believe the science? Or maybe throw caution to the wind and
party on like it's 2019? I mean, after all, hardly anyone in the USA
has died so far, right? Maybe it's not so bad. These projections are just
estimates anyway -- the risk doesn't seem large. And besides, the youth will
be fine anyway, so what's the problem here?

<p>
I wonder honestly, should the youth even really care?
