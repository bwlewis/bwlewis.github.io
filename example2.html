<b>Example 2 &#8195; 41 &#215; 88 </b>
<table width="90%" border="0"><tr><td>

Observe if we move the left index of the C-scale over the first factor
<b>41</b>, that the second factor <b>88</b> runs off the edge
of the D-scale and can't be read!
<form>
<input type="button" value="Show me" onclick="ex21();" />
</form>
<p/>
We can instead position the <i>right</i> index of the C-scale (the right-most 1 on the C-scale) over the first factor 
<b>41</b> on the D-scale.
Then position the cursor hairline over the second factor (<b>88</b>) 
on the C-scale. 
Read the approximate answer of <b>3.61 &#215; 10<sup>3</sup></b>  directly
below on the D-scale. We need to keep track of the decimal place 
on our own in this problem.
<form>
<input type="button" value="Show me" onclick="ex2();" />
</form>
<p/>
The C and D scales are logarithmic. The left and right indices represent
a scale factor of 10. If the D-scale were extended to the left, we would
see that positioning the right index of the C-scale over <b>41</b> also
positions the left index over <b>4.1</b>.  Since we keep track of the
decimal place independently of the computation, the result is the same.
